## Add a Repository

Once GitHub is connected, you can start adding repositories for indexing.

<Note>
  All members of your organization will have access to the indexed repositories. Make sure you only index repositories that you want to share with your entire team.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Repository URL">
    Navigate to the repositories section and click on "Add Repository". Enter the GitHub repository URL you want to index.

  <Step title="Verify Repository Access">
    The system will check if Depth AI has the necessary permissions to access your repository.

    <Note>
      If this is your first time adding a repository, you'll need to install and configure the Depth AI GitHub app.

    2. You'll be redirected to GitHub's permission page
    3. Choose either "All repositories" or "Only select repositories"
