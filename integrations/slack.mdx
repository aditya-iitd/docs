Depth AI's Slack integration allows you to interact with your codebase directly from Slack. You can ask questions about your code, get explanations, and deploy specialized assistants to specific channels.

## Connecting to Slack

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Slack Integration">
    Navigate to the [Slack Integration settings](https://app.trydepth.ai/new-settings/integrations/slack) in your Depth AI dashboard and click the "Connect" button.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploying Specialized Assistants

<Card title="Deploy Assistants" icon="slack" href="/guides/assistants">
  You can create specialized assistants trained on specific parts of your codebase and deploy them to different Slack channels.
</Card>

## Chat context

When you start a new chat or mention Depth AI in direct messages, the assistant will use your default repository as its knowledge source.

<Note>
  In channels where you've deployed specialized assistants, the assistant's knowledge base takes precedence over the default repository context. This allows you to have assistants specialized in different parts of your codebase in different channels.
</Note>
